== Description ==

**If you create for example a Wiki or multiple Pages with the same Content, you can use this Plugin to generate your Content!**
Create a Template and let wi_Posts create as many Pages as you want. 
If you need a different word inside this Template, you can just set a Placeholder, which will be set in your Post.
You even got the Option to set a Repeater, which will be set to the Template like a Placeholder. It will repeat your Text as often as you need it (Even Placeholder).

**There are sooooo many different possibilities!**


== How to use wi_Posts? ==

1. Create a Placeholder (The Name of the Placeholder will get replaced!).
2. Create a Repeater (Repeats your Text or your Placeholder).
3. Create a Template (You can write the Template with the Visual Editor or with HTML!). You should add some Placeholder or Repeater, which will be later replaced.

5. Add Value of the Placeholders at your newly created Post.
6. Change Status to Published!
